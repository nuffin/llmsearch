# Semantic Search

[中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

Perform efficient semantic search through local or remote large model backends and ElasticSearch to reduce hardware requirements.

Suitable for personal use with relatively low hardware configurations, and also for organizations with local large model backends deployed.

By uploading documents in various file formats, re-training can be performed according to one's own needs.

## Requirements

Python 3.x (3.8-3.11, for PyTorch and Tensorflow)
